# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript repository! This codebase documents my progression through the **SMIT Module-2 JavaScript Course**, covering everything from the fundamentals of programming to advanced DOM manipulation and Object-Oriented Programming.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is structured to follow the course curriculum, organized into specific modules for easy navigation:

### 1. Core JavaScript Classes (`Class-1` to `Class-25`)
These folders contain the daily lessons and exercises covering the building blocks of JavaScript.
- **Topics Covered:** Variables, Data Types, Loops (`for`, `while`), Conditional Logic (`if/else`), Arrays, Objects, Functions, and ES6 features.

### 2. 🌐 DOM Manipulation (`DOM/`)
This section focuses on making web pages interactive using the **Document Object Model**.
- **Classes:** `DOM/Class-1` to `DOM/Class-4`
- **Projects:** Real-world UI interactions and dynamic content updates.

### 3. 🧩 Object-Oriented Programming (`OOP/`)
Advanced programming concepts using Classes, Objects, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

### 4. 🛠️ Assignments & Projects (`Assignment/`)
A collection of hands-on projects to apply theoretical knowledge.
- **🧮 Utilities:** Age Calculator, Standard Calculator, Color Generator.
- **🎮 Games:** Chasing Game.
- **✅ Productivity:** To-Do List Application.

### 5. 🎹 JS30 Challenge (`JS30/`)
Projects inspired by the famous "JavaScript 30" challenge, built using vanilla JavaScript without external libraries.

## 📖 How to Study from this Repository

To get the most out of this repository as a developer, follow this professional study workflow:

### 1. Review the Code
Navigate to a specific class folder (e.g., `Class-10`). Open `app.js` to read the logic. I have included comments to explain complex sections.

### 2. Run the Code
Most folders contain an `index.html` file.
- **Open** the `index.html` file in your browser.
- **Inspect** the page using Chrome DevTools (`F12` or `Right Click > Inspect`).
- Go to the **Console** tab to see the output of the JavaScript code and interact with variables.

### 3. Practice & Experiment
- **Clone the Repo:** `git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Shayan001/JS_Journey.git`
- **Break it:** Try changing values or logic in the code to see what happens.
- **Fix it:** Debugging is a crucial skill.
- **Rebuild:** Try to recreate the `Assignment` projects from scratch without looking at my code first.
